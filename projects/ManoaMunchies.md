Manoa Munchies is a Web Application which targets students apart of the University of Manoa. Manoa Munchies is an application designed to allow users to find food items and the associated vendor's location in relation to the user. It also allows users to save, like and rate items which can be viewed by other users allowing friends to know what each friends want. The app also describes each of the vendors and their hours of operations.

There were three members of this team, with implementation tasks divided amongst members by preference. One task I ended up doing including refactoring naming conventions for a more logical, streamlined and functioning application. Other tasks included creating a couple database collections that would include both the construction of the collection, and a base collection set to run and test functionality of the application. Another task that all members were responsible for was to fix any issues that caused application crashes or failure of collection population in the web app. Lastly, every member was expected to be able to help with the development process which didn't necessarily mean implementation but also planning and brainstorming ideas for possible application formatting and the like.

This project provided a lot of experience when dealing with a large scale project. Management becomes a very important concept to consider when dealing with multiple people working on so many different files which may or may not interfere with another members work. The first of these includes task management. Making sure to not step on other users by making separate branches utilizing github. This also assures that new implementations can be tested before being thrown into the master code assuring new additions don't damage existing ones. Another thing that became a universal problem for our group was naming convention. We noticed things weren't logical from one person to another, and did not maintain consistent naming throughout variables or directories and such, requiring full system renaming which can become time consuming and problematic.

The biggest challenges I dealth with personally included trying to create something from scratch.
