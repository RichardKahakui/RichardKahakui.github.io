We've finally come to that point in the semester where our professor brings out the big guns. The end all, does all masterpeice which incorporates everything we've learned thus far. Meteor is the web app development tool which as its name implies, has so much power and potential.

My first reaction, and my second, and possibly even my first couple weeks worth of experiences would suggest that the potential meteor has is devastating.

<h3>Meteor Has Impacted</h3>
Much like what a meteor would do the the earth is what  Meteor has done to my brain. It quickly came into my life and blew my mind to smithereens. With so many different directories, files and new formatting, I quickly found myself heavily relying on video guided tutorials telling me exactly what to do, much like a child learning how to speak.
