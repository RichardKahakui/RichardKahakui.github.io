We've finally come to that point in the semester where our professor brings out the big guns. The end all, does all masterpeice which incorporates everything we've learned thus far. Meteor is the web app development tool which as its name implies, has so much power and potential.

My first reaction, and my second, and possibly even my first couple weeks worth of experiences would suggest that the potential meteor has is devastating.
<br>
<h3>Meteor Has Impacted</h3>
Much like what a meteor would do to the earth is what  Meteor has done to my brain. It quickly came into my life and blew my mind to smithereens. With so many different directories, files and new formatting, I quickly found myself heavily relying on video guided tutorials telling me exactly what to do, much like a child learning how to speak.

It was safe to say that at this point, i've pretty much been devastated and lacked self confidence in my potential to work on practice assignments on my own.

<h3>Salvaging the Wreckage</h3>
Luckily, practice does help to learn something, and although the assignments have an end date, the amount of times the assignment can be repeated does not. This is highly beneficial because the more exposure to Meteor I received the more I could understand the power Meteor provided. Slowly but surely as I continued to go through the assignments and see Meteor in action I slowly felt accomplishment with each task as well as regaining confidence in my ability to learn web app development.

<h3>Shock and Awe</h3>
Just when you thought you were starting to understand the different aspects of Meteor, it surprises you and brings a new powerful yet completely confusing idea to the table. However, it is nothing a few scattered but invested hours can't solve. And with that said, once I was able to complete the entirety of our practice assignment, and finally had a second to see everything working and running together, it beckoned nothing but sheer admiration.
