being your first time, you pull out all your crayons and color to your hearts content.

it meant for something to be sexy. And then you reflect. All you really did was create 
several dozen never before seen shapes that not even your best friend Brett would 
appreciate. <small> There goes Tati and Jake into the sunset as they make use of my
drawing to wrap their now tasteless gum.</small>
