Remember back to your younger days, still in grade school and its art time. And this
being your first time, you pull out all your crayons and color to your hearts content. 
You draw the most beautiful, amazingly epic drawing that you've ever laid witness to.
Now finished you're about to share with cute little Tatiana and you realize Jake with the 
nice shoes and nice hair and nice... actually drew your first visual understanding of what
it meant for something to be sexy, next to Tati of course. And then you reflect. All you 
really did was create several dozen never before seen shapes that not even your best 
friend Brett would appreciate. <i> There goes Tati and Jake into the sunset as they 
make use of my drawing to wrap their now tasteless gum.</i>

Just like little old you, we all know how to do a basic UI design using html and css. Even
those who don't, can very quickly pick up the basics through many of the free and easy 
online coding courses. But once you finish you'll quickly realize one of the issues of 
the base version, is that it's quite difficult to make it really how you want it. Whether
it is the immense time it takes to format things properly or the sexy factor that 
initially look for when you first visit a web page, these are all addressed when using a 
UI Framework.

For my ICS 314 we began dipping into Semantic UI as our choice of UI Frameworks. Our 
choice with Semantic UI was likely due to the logical format of which Semantic UI tries to
use when defining elements and variations.
