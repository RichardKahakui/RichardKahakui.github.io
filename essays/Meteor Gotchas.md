<h2> Meteor the Biggest Beast Yet</h2>
	<p>
	App development is an extremely powerful yet tricky thing to get a handle of. Learning
	something like basic web page development takes no longer than a few days and kablowie,
	your on your way with a working page. Even upgrading that via some type of framework like
	Semantic UI also might take a week to learn and therefore Kaplow, ur off with a nicer 
	looking web page. But web app is a whole new monster. The following will go over just
	a couple of the issues that I have encountered thus far.</p>
	<br>

<h2> Let the Trials and Tribulation Begin</h2>
	<p>
	In the first week of my meteor experience, i was literally a zombie. I did exactly what
	tutorials said to do with little to no comprehension of how they were doing things. It
	was so bad, that even after copying what i thought was "exactly" what they were doing 
	i was still getting compile errors and thus forcing myself to repeat tutorials more than once.
	This problem only evolved when we started our first assignments in meteor during the second week.
	<p>
	<br>
	<p>After retrieving all the files and being able to run metoer in just a few minutes at most,
	i felt like i was going to smash these assignments. Good thing my computer is so much better than me
	because i needed all the extra time i could get. The first major issue for me was the 
	organization of the meteor app development. Not saying meteor organization is bad, in fact 
	i think they're organization is amazing. However, I had no idea why things where in 
	this or that directory, and why things were split up. For a while i kind of just accepted
	that "this goes here, and that goes there. Period". Only later did i realize that its somewhat logical
	such that things that relate to the users only get placed in the <em> Client</em> directory.
	Things that deal with just the server get placed in the <em> Server</em> directory. even though
	I understand a few of the organization choices and when making things myself, i still find myself 
	becoming confused of where to place a new file due to the overwhelming amount of places 
	that a file might be placed.</p>
	
	<p>If things weren't worse enough as is, we introduced js allowing use to tailor made
	our webpage to what we want. When running through our third task of 6, we begin adding 
	behaviors to our web app. For use specifically, it allows us to prompt a user through 
	the use of forms and let them submit data to a collection where upon submission the page
	either responds with a red rejection in the fields where data is necessary or a green
	submission successful.</p>
