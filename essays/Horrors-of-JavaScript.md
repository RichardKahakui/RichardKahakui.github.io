Although not actually a horror, learning new syntax sometimes can be. Even worse if one doesnâ€™t consistently code. The JavaScript 1 assignment that I completed this week includes a basic introduction to JavaScript using FreeCodeCamp, two timed practice Euler Problems, and an in-class quiz problem called WOD, and my experiences on them.

FreeCodeCamp did have a couple buggy issues, but the overall experience was very informative and quite thorough in depth about the basics of the language. However, with how brief the topics are covered, it is easy to forget about new syntax or special functions available in JavaScript. Even though it is quick to run through, FreeCodeCamp saves your work completed and can be reviewed at any later time as reference for the basic topics. 

To solidify the crash course to JavaScript, students were engaged in at least two programming problems. These Euler problems were difficult for me at first mostly due to a lack of consistency in programming. I do not currently have a general strategy used to attempt problems in a timely fashion. However, after reviewing how solutions given by the professor, I felt more exposed to alternate quicker methods. 

All in all, I do feel like I am still week at programming for the time being. I was, however, able to expose myself to a few new skills during both Euler problems and in class quiz. The Quizzes and Euler problems seem to be a good teaching element that focuses on improving speed and efficiency, but will be very difficult for someone like me who takes longer to recall strategies and tricks as well as properly applying new syntax and special additions for JavaScript.
