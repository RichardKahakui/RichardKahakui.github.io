### Management in Programming?
Configuration Management is a basic yet seemingly advanced practice when learning 
programming. Although it usually does appear in one's first programming class, the depth
in which the class highlights configuration management only scratches the surface. The 
same has occurred for me and didn't advance until I entered an upper division software 
engineering course with the use of Git/GitHub.

### First Impressions
My first experiences with any sort of Configuration Management is in my first programming
class where we learned C through unix. If even considered such, The organization of any 
files and projects were all saved in our user directories. This provides the problem
that everything has to be manually navigated through. Although in the right hands it can
can be potentially powerful, in my experience navigation was the easiest task but moving
and transferring anything was a nightmare! I often wished there was a quicker and less 
problematic way of moving files let alone renaming them.

Further more, in future programming classes, you also have the issue of group assignments.
When you develop a program with other group members you will always run into the issue of
how to code simultaneously and how to update your finished code with your partners
unfinished code. Group members tend to help because work can be divided and problems can 
be finished sooner. However, especially when working in unix, collaborating on the same
assignment becomes a catastrophe when members save over other peoples code, replacing
completed chunks of working code. Hours of work completely down the drain. The desperate
attempt of finding the optimal collaboration IDE lingers with the end of each of class.

### Best Outcome

But thankfully! transcending past unix and into the 21st century, we now have the beauty 
which is **Git/GitHub**. Git/GitHub is that God sent prodigy child that allows for all your
organization, management and even collaboration issues to be addressed given you nurture
your growth with Git. 

- No Longer worry about dealing with directories now that there is one place to keep your 
files in a repository using their easy to follow user interface. 
- NO LONGER look and replace and copy files from all over when they're all located in one 
place. 
- **NO LONGER** deal with annoying team members who step on your code and cause a desperate 
cram sesh to recreate hours of work, since now you can branch off similar working code 
altar just what you need and push up only the changes necessary.


GitHub with it's cloud based not only allows friends to collaborate, but also allows you
to publish your work for all to 
Even further, in addition to working on your browser, you can quickly work off their 
desktop app without having to go through the difficulties of having a browser. Their 
desktop app isn't just an alternative, its an improvement allowing for quicker changes 
and updates.

GitHub seems to be the most popular Configuration Management tool and not by accident. 
Coders know the issues and Git has addressed them. And with the ability to work off their
desktop it is even more comfortable. I have found it more efficient than any other method
and it is quick to pick up since it runs from a familiar interface that all are used to.
For your next group project or large scale personal project, Git to the Hub and check out
the power they can bestow to you.
